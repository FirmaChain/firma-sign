# Drag and Drop File Organization Feature

## Overview

The File Explorer now supports drag and drop functionality in **Manual mode**, allowing users to organize their files by dragging them into custom folders.

## How to Use

### 1. Enable Manual Mode

- Look for the "Organization Mode" section in the File Explorer header
- Click the "Manual" button to switch from Automatic to Manual mode
- The button will turn blue when active

### 2. Create Custom Folders

- In Manual mode, click the folder icon (üìÅ+) in the File Explorer header
- Enter a name for your new folder
- The folder will be created at the root level

### 3. Organize Files with Drag and Drop

#### Moving Files into Folders:

1. Click and hold on any file
2. Drag it over a folder - the folder will highlight in blue
3. Release to drop the file into that folder
4. The file will be moved immediately

#### Moving Files to Root Level:

1. Click and hold on any file (even if it's inside a folder)
2. Drag it to an empty area in the File Explorer
3. The background will turn slightly blue
4. Release to drop the file at the root level

#### Moving Folders:

- You can also drag and drop folders into other folders
- This creates nested folder structures

### 4. Visual Feedback

- **Dragging**: The item being dragged becomes semi-transparent (50% opacity)
- **Valid Drop Target**: Folders highlight with a blue background when you can drop into them
- **Root Drop Zone**: The entire file tree area gets a light blue tint when dropping to root

## Technical Implementation

### Components Updated

1. **FileExplorer.tsx**: Passes the `moveItem` function to FileTree when in manual mode
2. **FileTree.tsx**: Handles root-level drops and propagates drag/drop events
3. **FileNode.tsx**: Implements draggable behavior for files
4. **FolderNode.tsx**: Implements both draggable behavior and drop target functionality
5. **useFileSystem.ts**: Contains the `moveItem` logic that updates the file structure

### Key Features

- **Persistence**: The manual folder structure is saved to localStorage
- **Path Updates**: File paths are automatically updated when moved
- **Nested Support**: Supports unlimited folder nesting
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visual indicators for drag states
- **Root Level Support**: Files can be moved back to root level

### Data Flow

```
User drags file ‚Üí onDragStart sets item ID in dataTransfer
                ‚Üì
User hovers over folder ‚Üí onDragOver prevents default, shows visual feedback
                ‚Üì
User drops ‚Üí onDrop gets item ID, calls moveItem(itemId, targetFolderId)
                ‚Üì
useFileSystem.moveItem ‚Üí Updates file structure
                ‚Üì
localStorage saves structure ‚Üí UI re-renders with new structure
```
