## Value Proposition

### The Problem We Solve

In a world moving towards decentralization, why do we still rely on centralized services for something as fundamental as document signing?

Traditional e-signature platforms:

- Store your sensitive documents on their servers
- Charge recurring fees for basic functionality
- Create single points of failure
- Own your data and signing history

---

## Mission Statement

### Our Mission

To democratize document signing by creating a truly decentralized, peer-to-peer signing infrastructure that puts control back in users' hands.

### Our Vision

A world where document signing is as simple as sending a message, as secure as blockchain technology, and as free as the internet itself.

---

## How It Works (Simple 3-Step Process)

### 1. Upload & Prepare

Upload your document and add signature fields - everything happens in your browser

### 2. Share Directly

Send documents directly to recipients through peer-to-peer connections - no server required

### 3. Sign & Certify

Recipients sign instantly, blockchain certifies permanently - complete transparency

---

## Key Features (Non-Technical)

### 🌐 **True Peer-to-Peer**

Documents travel directly from you to recipients. No uploads to corporate servers. Your data stays yours.

## Technology (Simple Explanation)

### Peer-to-Peer Magic

Just like how you can video call someone directly, Firma-Sign lets you send documents directly to recipients. No middleman needed.

### Blockchain Security

Think of blockchain as a permanent, public notary. Once signed, your document's signature is recorded forever - anyone can verify it, no one can change it.

### Privacy First

Your actual documents never touch the blockchain - only a unique "fingerprint" (hash) that proves the signature is real.

---

## FAQs

### Is it really free?

Yes! The core P2P signing functionality will always be free. Premium features like advanced workflows may have optional fees.

### Do I need cryptocurrency?

No! While blockchain certifies your signatures, you don't need to own or understand cryptocurrency to use Firma-Sign.

### Is it legally binding?

Digital signatures are legally recognized in most countries. Blockchain certification adds an extra layer of verification.

### What if the recipient isn't online?

Documents can be shared through multiple methods - direct P2P, email links, or temporary encrypted storage.
