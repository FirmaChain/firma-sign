## Value Proposition

### The Problem We Solve

Traditional e-signature platforms lock you into their ecosystem. They control your data, charge recurring fees, and you're dependent on their servers staying online.

What if you could:

- Run your own document signing system
- Own 100% of your code and data
- Customize every aspect to your needs
- Never pay subscription fees
- Connect directly peer-to-peer without intermediaries

---

## Mission Statement

### Our Mission

To democratize document signing by creating a truly decentralized, peer-to-peer signing infrastructure that puts control back in users' hands.

### Our Vision

A world where document signing is as simple as sending a message, as secure as blockchain technology, and as free as the internet itself.

### 2. Upload & Prepare

## The Web3 Advantage

### Realistic Web3 Implementation

While others talk about decentralization, we've built it. Firma-Sign uses:

- **P2P Technology** for direct document transfer (no servers)
- **Blockchain** only for what it does best - permanent certification
- **Your Browser** as the application (no installation needed)
- **Open Standards** ensuring no vendor lock-in

This isn't theoretical - it's working today.

## Technology (Simple Explanation)

### Peer-to-Peer Magic

Just like how you can video call someone directly, Firma-Sign lets you send documents directly to recipients. No middleman needed.

### Blockchain Security

Think of blockchain as a permanent, public notary. Once signed, your document's signature is recorded forever - anyone can verify it, no one can change it.

### Privacy First

Your actual documents never touch the blockchain - only a unique "fingerprint" (hash) that proves the signature is real.
